# A html5 project
This is in a very early alpha stage. This will be an interactive n-body solver. The user will draw out the distribution and the client will numerically integrate the objects gravitationally interacting. 
## Current State
	*Right now the user is allowed to draw out circles.
	*RK4 is not implemented.
	*Collision detection is too simple.
	*User can only create and run. No reset. No Save.
### Usage
Run gameMain.html in any browser. 100% working in Firefox.

Peace.
